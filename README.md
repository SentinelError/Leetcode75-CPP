# Leetcode75
This repository contains the notes made while attempting the 75 questions of the Leetcode 75.

I attempt the questions in the following manner :
1. I formulate an algorithm on paper and then convert that into code by my self
   1.5 Most Algorithms attempt through a basic brute force before I attempt to optimize it
2. I then check the solutions and learn my mistakes and what other users have utilized
3. I check online for other answers
4. I run the code through ChatGPT to provide the optimized code and mention the errors in my code and what I could've done better.
5. I then write the code off of my memory on what I learnt.

I hope this helps you better at coding as it helped me become better at tracking my progress.
For the first round of the 75, I have decided to write the solutions in C++
